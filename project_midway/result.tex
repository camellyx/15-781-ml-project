\section{Experimental Results}
\label{sec:result}

First Steps and Evaluation (10 points): Were the first steps described in the
project proposal completed? Are there nontrivial preliminary results in terms of
system performance or data collection (if data collection is a significant part
of the project)? Is the interpretation of these results careful and correct? Is
there an assessment of where the project stands? Are next steps clear, including
any course corrections based on preliminary results?
