\section{Problem Definition}
\label{sec:problem}

% Goals
% Define neural network models

In this project, we will investigate the hypothesis that consistency
relaxing can improve model accuracy by introducing various types of noise
into different neural network models.

We compare our results with recent works in~\cite{chilimbi14adam,
wan2013dropconnect, goodfellow13maxout, dean2012large} and consider any
improvement in accuracy or convergence rate in the final results to be a
success.
