\section{Introduction}

%%%% Question and Goals (10 points): State the updated version of the research question, based on results so far. Is it well-formed and interesting? Are there well-defined metrics for success? Is the minimum goal achievable in the remaining time? Are the stretch goals interesting?

{\bf Problem:}
Large-scale deep neutral network models have become increasingly popular
to solve hard classification problems and have demonstrated sigificant
improvements in accuracy. Due to the scale of the neutral network and the
scale of the input data set, performance, in addition to accuracy, has
become a significant factor in such deep learning implementations.

{\bf Goal:}
We intend to comprehensively study how adding noise to the training
process will affect the performance and accuracy of neural network models.
We expected our results to pave the way for future exploration of
hardware approximate computation or storage techniques to accelerate
and improve the training process of large-scale deep learning models.

{\bf Metrics:} %%% Not sure about this part %%%
We are interested in the improvement of error rate, convergence rate
and training speed.
We consider a 0.99\% decrease in test error rate to be significant.
